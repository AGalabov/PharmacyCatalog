# PharmacyCatalog
The purpose of this project is to create a catalog of medicines, supplements and cosmetics offered in a pharmacy, based on XML documents with text and graphic content, describing the products, their cost, availability, etc. The catalog presents graphical content through XML objects. Links in the catalogue are described by ID / IDREF attributes. There is information about 5 medicines, 3 cosmetic products and 2 types of supplements. The XML content is validated via a properly designed DTD document and presented in PDF document through generation via XSLT.
